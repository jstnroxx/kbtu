# Practice 2: Python Control Flow Basics

## Objective

This practice focuses on learning Python control flow structures including conditionals and loops. You will work through W3Schools exercises covering Boolean operations, if-else statements, and for loops, saving all examples to your GitHub repository.

## Tasks

### Learn Python Control Flow from W3Schools

Read and complete exercises from W3Schools Python Tutorial (Boolean to For loops):

🔗 **W3Schools Python**: [https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)

**Topics to Cover**:
- Boolean Values
- Booleans as Comparison Results
- Boolean Operators
- If Statement
- If Else
- If Elif Else
- Short Hand If Else

### Save Examples to GitHub

Organize and save all (at least 5 examples or all examples if there are less than 5)  code examples to your GitHub repository:

**Repository Structure**:
```
