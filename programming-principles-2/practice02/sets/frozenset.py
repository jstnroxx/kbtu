# frozenset is an immutable version of a set.
# Use the frozenset() constructor to create a frozenset from any iterable.
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
print(x)
print(type(x))

# Being immutable means you cannot add or remove elements. However, frozensets support all non-mutating operations of sets.
